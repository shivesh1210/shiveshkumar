I am an Assistant Professor in Dynamics and Control of Mechanical Systems at the Dynamics Division of Department of Mechanical and Maritime Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. My research interests include kinematics, dynamics and control of robots with a pursuit to develop animal-like physical/athletic intelligence. I also work as a part-time Senior Researcher at the Robotics Innovation Center, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Bremen, Germany where I maintain an advisory relationship with the Advanced AI Team: Team Mechanics & Control and the Underactuated Robotics Lab. I am an associate co-chair of the IEEE-RAS Technical Committee on Model Based Optimization for Robotics.

My educational background brings together an interesting mix of various domains such as computer science, mathematics, robotics and mechanical engineering. In 2019, I got my PhD from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bremen where I was awarded the distinction summa cum laude. During 2013 to 2015, I received my Masters in Control Engineering, Robotics and Applied Informatics from Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France with a specialization in Advanced Robotics. I was also an Erasmus Mundus HERITAGE scholar there. From 2009 to 2013, I studied for my Bachelors in Technology (B. Tech.) degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India.
