I am an Assistant Professor in Dynamics and Control at the [Dynamics Division](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/m2/research/dynamics/) of [Department of Mechanical and Maritime Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/m2/) at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/), Gothenburg, Sweden. My research interests include kinematics, dynamics and control of robots with a pursuit to develop animal-like physical/athletic intelligence. I also work as a part-time Senior Researcher at the [Robotics Innovation Center, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage) in Bremen, Germany where I maintain an advisory relationship with the [Advanced AI Team: Team Mechanics & Control](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/teams/mechanics-control) and the [Underactuated Robotics Lab](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/research-facilities-labs/underactuated-lab). I am an associate co-chair of the IEEE-RAS Technical Committee on [Model Based Optimization for Robotics](https://www.tcoptrob.org/).

My educational background brings together an interesting mix of various domains such as computer science, mathematics, robotics and mechanical engineering. In 2019, I got my PhD from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/) where I was awarded the highest distinction summa cum laude. During my PhD, I developed a modular software framework called Hybrid Robot Dynamics (HyRoDyn) which can be used to solve kinematics and dynamics of highly complex series-parallel hybrid robots. HyRoDyn now sits at the heart of various control architectures of robots at DFKI-RIC. During 2013 to 2015, I received my Masters in Control Engineering, Robotics and Applied Informatics from [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version), France with a specialization in Advanced Robotics. I was also an Erasmus Mundus HERITAGE scholar there. From 2009 to 2013, I studied for my Bachelors in Technology (B. Tech.) degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), Surathkal, India.
